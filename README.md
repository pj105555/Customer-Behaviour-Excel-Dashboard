Hello Connections
I am excited to share my Excel Project "Customer Behaviour Report"

I have tried to analyze the followings things through Dashboard:

> Orders: Men Vs Women
> Recurring Customers : Top 5 States
> Season Wise Sales Distribution
> Orders:Age Group
> Orders: Shipping Type
> Sales: Category
> Impact Of PromoCode on Orders
> Orders: Rating Vs Repeated Purchases
> Orders : Mode Of Payment
> Top 5 Items Purchased

Insights:
1) Mens are Purchasing More Than Women (~68%)
2) Illionis,Albama and Montana have the Highest Repeated Customers as Compared To Other States in U.S.A .
3) Store has the highest Sales in fall Season (~26%)
4) Customer prefer buying clothing product as compared to other product in the Store
5) Items with Excellent Rating Have good amount of Repeated Orders
6) Blouse and Shirts are the Highest Item Purchased.
7) Senior Customers has purchased the highest amount of items from the store as Compared to Adult and Teenager

Conclusion : 
Store Should Target Senior Men Living in Illionis,Albama and Montana in fall Season by showing more ads/offers/coupons on Clothing Product having Good Rating
